# Overview

This program was created as part of me teaching myself C++. I spent a lot of time following online tutorials from site like Sololearn, W3 Schools, and Youtube.

I thought that an address book would be a great program to work on to help myself learn for several reasons. The first one is that there weren't very many tutorials online that would straight up walk you through making a address book, so I had to rely more on my own knowledge, therefore making it so I had to have a stronger understanding of the language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
